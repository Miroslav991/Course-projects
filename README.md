# Trafic-Light
This application was homework exercise, task for this exercise was to implement **STATE pattern** But as i play with code i found some other options, so i decided to expand it
In this version of code you will also find **OBSERVER pattern, Singleton pattern** Process of changing lights is automatized, i decided to use **Thread** for this.
So your job is only to press button, app will do the rest.
To start this app, just run **Main** class.
Here are intervals for each ligh: **RED 7sec**, **RED/YELLOW 3sec**, **GREEN 5sec**, **YELLOW 3sec**.
